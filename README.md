This projectt tackles the classic Sequence Alignment problem via:

Basic Dynamic Programming (full table)

Memory‑Efficient DP (linear space, Hirschberg‑style)

Given two DNA sequences X and Y, the goal is to find an alignment (with gaps –) minimizing:

A fixed gap penalty δ per gap & A mismatch cost
